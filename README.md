5. Powerful content

8. Clear calls to action

Want people to apply for that home loan? Include an “Apply Now” button prominently on the page, typically placed above the fold, where the user won’t miss it. Whatever you do, don’t use the words “click here”. Not only is that not descriptive for the typical user who is invariably scanning the page for exactly what to do, but it’s also not ADA compliant, a common requirement for institutions. The best FI sites make the calls to action clear and thereby assist the user and funnel conversions.

clear link to your Contact Us or Customer Services pages, and provide alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as Live Chat and phone. Additionally, group helpful pages together in a menu, such as FAQs and other resources.
